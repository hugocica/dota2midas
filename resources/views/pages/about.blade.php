     <p> A secured marketplace allowing you to exchange your Dota 2 goodies for real life money.

            Dota2Midas enables its users to trade their Dota 2 items in a secure marketplace environment and sell them for real cash. The idea behind such a project is to put an end to all of the scams happening in the Dota 2 marketplace. Dota2Midas has been closely following our competitors’ releases, but after months of empty promises, we have decided to fill the gap ourselves with a secure marketplace for Dota 2 players to buy and sell items.

            Dota2Midas keeps items sellers safe from PayPal chargebacks because we process the items transactions through our marketplace, instead of sellers trading directly to buyers. Sellers can then redeem their Coins through Dota2Midas and get real life money deposited into their PayPal account. Buyers purchase Coins from Dota2Midas and use their Coins to buy Dota 2 items. We verify buyer’s identities through a one-time security check to prevent fraudulent Coins purchases. Through these security measures, we’ve created a safe platform where sellers can trade Steam Dota 2 items for real cash, and buyers are confident in their items purchases.

            The team behind Dota2Midas is passionate and composed of experienced technology entrepreneurs, UI designers and developers. The Dota2Midas support staff is dedicated to ensuring the utmost customer satisfaction among all items buyers and sellers. Please head over to the help section for FAQ's and to learn more about how to safely and securely buy and sell Dota 2 items through the Dota2Midas marketplace.
